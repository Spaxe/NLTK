Forbes, the Minister for the Army, on Monday next, November 16th, when 
 the Minister visited Exercise Ever Ready in the Nelson-Heywood area.

sitting of the House next week, during which the Prime Minister's
defence statement and the National Service Bill will be debated, made
a visit to the Exercise impossible, Malcolm Fraser said he believed
it would also not be possible for the Minister for the Army to make 
the visit,
